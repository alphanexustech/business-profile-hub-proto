# 002 - JWT
Date: 2021-03-02

## Context

Authentication strategies include JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and Session Cookies. While both strategies have downsides and security concerns, both strategies also have many upsides. A notable constraint with JWT Tokens is the handling of CORS.

## Decision

JWT Tokens provide an ability to have, at least, service based oriented software with the potential to have many microservices in complex applications. Additionally, CORS and XSS are mitigated security concerns.

## Other Considerations

Software that needs to have a session would not work with the JWT implementation. Additionally, software teams lacking the appropriate expertise may consider a different path.
